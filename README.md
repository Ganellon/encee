## Background
After reading about a number of incidents related to AWS and the theft of credentials, I wanted to make a utility that makes it easier (and therefore more likely) for users to require MFA for CLI so that theft of user credentials doesn't result in fraudulent charges to one's AWS account.
The biggest obstacle to adoption of these practices is the AWS documentation; it is incomplete and inaccurate. After some hair pulling, I finally got things working and want to share these discoveries with others.

## Solution Files
* IPRestriction.json -- IP / CIDR Restriction Policy doc for AWS
* MFARequired.json -- MFA Requirement Policy doc for AWS
* config.sh -- bash script to automate some of the setup process (optional)
* encee.sh -- encee bash script - to make environment variable changes that persist in the shell
* encee.py -- encee python script - to read the JSON returned by the AWS STS request

## Setup
1. Restriction policies are created on the AWS account, manually or with config.sh
    1. You can optionally have a new group named 'encee' added to your AWS account, and the included policies will be applied automatically to the newly created group
1. Ensure that MFA is enabled for every IAM user account that you want to secure. It's best practices, and without it, once the policy is applied, users without MFA will not be able to use AWS CLI.
1. Manually add AWS IAM User accounts to the 'encee' group (or whatever group you created).
1. Manually edit the IP Restriction Policy to reflect your IP address or CIDR block. All others are denied.
    * NOTE: This takes effect immediately! If the IP or CIDR you supply is incorrect, you will need to login to the AWS Console with your root credentials to make corrections to the IPRestriction Policy.
1. Copy the arn of the MFA device you intend to use.
1. Run the encee config python script to persist your MFA ARN in ~/.encee/config, or manually edit the file and paste the ARN of the MFA device for the user.

## Usage
1. `source encee.sh` provide your MFA token and desired validity duration when prompted

## How it works
1. encee.sh bash script requests temp credentials from AWS STS; you specify validity duration in seconds
1. AWS STS returns JSON that contains the temporary credentials
    * Secret Access Key
    * Access Key ID
    * Session Token
    * Expiration Time
1. Output is redirected to ./token.json
1. encee.py python script reads the token.json file and outputs environment variable values to ./temp.tmp
1. encee.sh reads ./temp.tmp and calls EXPORT to create / update the AWS environment variables and their values
    * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
    * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
    * `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
1. AWS CLI uses the provided temporary security token to authenticate any API calls; no MFA = no access
